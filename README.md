# Apache Sling ClassLoader Leak Detector

This module is part of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project.

This bundle provides support for tracing classloader leaks which occur due to
improper cleanup in bundles. Refer to [SLING-3359][1] for background details.

The bundle registers a Felix Configuration Printer which dumps out a list of
suspected classloaders which are not getting garbage collected.
It can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/system/console/status-leakdetector

 not garbage collected by default. This bundle relies on classloaders getting
 garbage collected for it work. So to enable that pass on following arguments

     -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
